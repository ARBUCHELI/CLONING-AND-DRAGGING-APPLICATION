# CLONING-AND-DRAGGING-APPLICATION

JavaScript App that can be used in different web platforms and for multiple applications (games, tests, educational content).

The App, everytime that the user clicks on one of the labeled squares clones the square.  Every new square will be generated with a random
color.

This type of code is very common in card games, multiple selection tests, etc.

The user can drag the cloned squares following the mouse and place them wherever the user wants.

The App, uses collision detection to drop the unwanted clones in a trash bin.

The following set of pictures shows how the app works.
