# CLONING-AND-DRAGGING-APPLICATION

JavaScript App that can be used in different web platforms and for multiple applications (games, tests, educational content).

The App, everytime that the user clicks on one of the labeled squares clones the square.  Every new square will be generated with a random
color.

This type of code is very common in card games, multiple selection tests, etc.

The user can drag the cloned squares following the mouse and place them wherever the user wants.

The App, uses collision detection to drop the unwanted clones in a trash bin.

<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>

Each time that the user clicks on one of the squares, a new square with a random color is generated.  In the example the user clicked two times in the square with the label "One", two times in the square with the label "Two", two times in the square with the label "Three", two times in the square with the label "Four", and two times in the square with the label "Five".

The user can drag the cloned squares around the screen, to place them wherever the user wants.

![Third position](https://github.com/anferebu/CLONING-AND-DRAGGING-APPLICATION/blob/master/third%20position.jpg)

The last function is the ability to drop the unwanted squares in the trash bin (this process can be repeated over and over again).
